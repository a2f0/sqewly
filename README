Sqewly (pronounced see-kwuhl-ee) is user-configurable backup utility for MySQL.
The script is intended to give a system administrator flexibility over how the
mysqldump command is executed and what actions are taken based on the result of
the dump operation. It has a limited but suitable feature set, specifically it
implements customizable email reporting, user-definable backup expiration, and
optional gzip/tar compression. It has some basic built-in safety logic (i.e. old
backups will not be rotated unless the most recent backup was successful). The
script abstracts configuration information into a separate config file
containing key value attribute pairs parsed by Python's native ConfigParser, and
implements the std-lib subprocess module to handle potential stderr returned by
spawned threads.
